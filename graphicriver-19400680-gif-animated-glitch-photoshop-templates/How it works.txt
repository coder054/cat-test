Note:
Before anything, pictures must be chosen carefully. There are pictures that do not work properly so you have to try several different pictures. Also, the editing depends on the quality and type of the photo, precision and colors’ intensity and its lighting. 



Some recommendations for optimal use:
Use a good quality pictures. I recommend using a photo with a resolution of at least between 2000-3000 pixels on one axis. For best effect use the 3000px photos.



How it works: 
Let’s start practice:
1.	open the file (Gif Animated Glitch - Photoshop Templates) that you purchased and downloaded (You may as well put the logo instead of the image with a pictorial background mode.
2.	Double click on smart creature layer Image and paste the image then close and save the work
3.	Go to the (window<Time Line) and then turn the moving effect 
4.	save your work format  (Gif)

This is it all, good luck…
